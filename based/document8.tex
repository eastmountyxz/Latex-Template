\begin{abstract}
The security situation in cyberspace is becoming more and more complex, and the traceability of malicious code attacks has become an important technical challenge facing the security protection system....

\section{Introduction}
In recent years, there have been more and more cyber security incidents and malicious code attacks, which have brought serious harm to the country....

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Research on Attack Tracing of Malicious Code}

Malicious code traceability refers to the discovery of the source of malicious code based on the characteristics of the target malicious code, as shown in Table I.

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\caption{The evolution and influence of PC Malware}
	\centering
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{cllp{6cm}}
			\hline
			Period & Malware & Type\\
			\hline
			1971 & Creeper & normal software \\
			1974 & Wabbit & normal software \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\label{tab1}
	\end{center}
\end{table}


The evolution of malware is divided into three stages, which are as follows:
	
\begin{itemize}
	\item The first stage is from 1971 to 1999...
	\item The second stage is from 2000 to 2008....
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Malicious Code Detection in Academia}

The process relationship between each stage is shown in Fig.1.

\noindent
\textbf{Feature Extraction.} Feature extraction is the basis of the traceability analysis process...

\noindent
\textbf{Feature Preprocessing.} If the ratio value is larger, the proof is more similar, as shown in the formula (1).

\begin{equation}
J(A,B) = \frac{|A \bigcap B|}{|A \bigcup B|} \label{eq}
\end{equation}

The feature extraction process will encounter unrepresentative and non-quantifiable original features.

\section{System Model}
To make up for the shortcomings of traditional malicious code attack source tracing based on single organization and attack chain...

\subsection{Research Framework}\label{RF}
The purpose of this paper is to trace the hacker organization and the author behind the malicious code..
